# Knockout-Node
This is a knockout based project using node as backend.

Pre-requiste for the project

    1. Node must be installed.
    2. Basic understanding of node and any mvc framework

Clone the project to your local and run the following command in order to start the server

    node server.js

This would create a local server running on port 3001

To get the list of service calls created open it on browser using localhost

    http://localhost:3001/

You will get the list of service calls in a tabular format.

Currently front-end is in starting phase, so if any one likes to check the service calls running one can use postman or fiddler to check the service calls running.
